# Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


For this module, I have marked where I got help from each code above the corresponding code. For the code itself, I had gotten help from Monika DesLauriers and ChatGPT (which I had specified which specific part of which specific question), and I had received help importing the data tables into SQL from Riley Taylor, Klaus Smit, and Michael Schell
